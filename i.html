                        The Celsius°Cooking™ system puts fine-tuned, technical control in the palm of your hand –
                        literally. Now you have the power to change, define, and monitor the temperatures and timings
                        of the food you cook with a new level of precision. And with the connected pan, hob, and probe,
                        the enjoyably hands-on experience of working on the hob becomes a finely-tuned culinary
                        adventure. Celsius°Cooking™ equipment links directly to the companion app from Hestan Cue
                        that not only allows you to set, control, and monitor temperatures and timings but which is also
                        home to a large collection of inspirational step-by-step recipes. Not only will this inspire you to
                        make something delicious, but it’s also the best way to learn how to use the Celsius°Cooking™
                        system: by getting your hands on it and seeing what it can really do
